# Philosophy

ToFlow is a **personal system for action and growth**. It's not just a tool for recording "what to do," but a methodology designed to help you solve three core problems we often face in a complex life: **Chaos**, **Decision Paralysis**, and **Lack of Accumulation**.

## 1. Stop the Chaos: Structure Your Life

**The Problem**:
The "Todos" we need to handle vary wildly. Some are lifelong pursuits (like "Career" or "Health"), some are temporary projects (like "Exam Prep"), and some are just errands like "Picking up a package." If you stuff all of these into a single flat list, you'll only feel overwhelmed because you can't distinguish priority.

**The ToFlow Way: Layers**

ToFlow uses a three-layer structure to house all your thoughts and tasks:

*   **Track (Areas of Life)**: The important, indivisible areas of your life, such as "Work," "Health," or "Family." These are the long-term tracks you invest in.
*   **Project**: Specific undertakings within a Track that you are currently pushing forward. They have a beginning and an end.
*   **Todo (Actions)**: The atomic, clear next steps.

This structure ensures that for every small action, you know which project it belongs to and which life direction it serves. **It's not just categorization; it's awareness.**

## 2. Stop Overthinking: Separate Planning from Doing

**The Problem**:
When you have dozens of tasks, "what to do next" becomes a huge mental burden. We often waste willpower weighing options and end up procrastinating.

**The ToFlow Way: Separate "Thinking" and "Doing"**

ToFlow designs two distinct modes:

*   **Box (Inbox)**: When you are busy and suddenly think "I need to buy milk" or have a new idea, don't let it interrupt you. Throw it into the Box. This is your buffer zone.
*   **Now (Focus Mode)**: When you are ready to work, enter Now mode. There are no complex lists here, just a **Pomodoro timer** and the one thing you are doing right now. It follows a minimalist philosophy: **Don't overthink, just start.**

## 3. Visualize Growth: Make Time Visible

**The Problem**:
In traditional todo lists, tasks disappear once checked off. After a busy year, it often feels like you have nothing to show for it, and you don't know where your time went.

**The ToFlow Way: The Value of Time**

ToFlow believes that finishing an action is not the end.

*   **Timeline**: Every focused session you complete is automatically recorded.
*   **Review**: Through the Timeline view, you can clearly see where you spent your time.

When you can visually see your sustained investment in a direction, that feedback itself is a huge motivation. **Turn "what you did" into a visible trajectory of growth.**
